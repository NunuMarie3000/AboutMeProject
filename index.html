		  	<h3>Short Biography</h3>
		  		<p>My name is Storm O'Bryant, and <strong>my pronouns are they/them</strong>. I was born in Memphis, TN, but grew up in Olive Branch, MS. I'm the oldest child of 6 and am hitting a factory reset on my life at the moment. I believe that I'm the orchestrator of my own life, and since I'm not happy, I'm making the conscious decision to change it. A few fun facts about myself: I love playing the My Sims games(not to be confused with the regular Sims games); I'm musically incined and can play a few instruments; and I love crocheting and am a small business owner selling my homemade wares(though I'm currently on a break). </p>
